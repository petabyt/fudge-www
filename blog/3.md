Fujifilm has a lot of desktop software:

- FUJIFILM TETHER APP
- FUJIFILM X Acquire
- FUJIFILM X RAW STUDIO
- FUJIFILM PC AutoSave
- FUJIFILM X Webcam

Ever wondered if somebody would come along and make open-source alternatives? Well, wonder no more.

Introducing:

Fudge for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

Currently, this software has two main features:
- Backup and Restore settings (X Acquire functionality)
- Raw Conversion (X RAW Studio functionality)

It comes with a decent CLI:
```
Fudge 0.1.0
Compilation date: April 1 2025
  --list
    List all PTP devices connected to this computer
  --dev <device number>
    Select a device to connect to instead of choosing the first available one.
  --raw <input raf> <output jpeg path> <profile file>
    Does a Raw conversion based on information parsed from a FP1/FP2/FP3 file.
  --backup <output dat path>
    Backs up camera settings to file.
  --restore <input dat path>
    Load camera settings from file.
  --dump-usb
    Dump all info on a camera. If something goes wrong you may want to send this info to developers.
  --script <filename>
    Execute a Lua script using fudge bindings
  --parse-fp <filename>
    Parse and dump a FP1/FP2/FP3 file
```

And the most awful looking UI you've ever seen:

It even has Lua bindings.
```
$ cat test.lua
x = ptp.getDeviceInfo()
print("You are connected to a " .. x["model"])
$ fudge --script test.lua
Connected to a Fuji camera, running test.lua
You are connected to a X-H1
```

## Raw Conversion
The main blocker for writing an X Raw Studio replacement has been the proprietary Fujifilm profile formats. To reverse-engineer them, I used [vcam](https://github.com/petabyt/vcam),
my camera emulator project, to spoof X Raw Studio running in a VM through vhci-hcd. I'll spare you the technical details, but this allowed me to manually clean-room reverse-engineer
these profile formats and create a [library to handle them](https://github.com/petabyt/fp).

The result is a CLI version of X Raw Studio.

Usage is as simple as: RAF + FP1/FP2/FP3 = output.jpg
```
$ fudge --raw ~/Pictures/DSC0000.RAF output.jpg MyProfile.FP1
```

FP1/FP2/FP3 files are Fuji's XML-based profile format used by X Raw Studio. You can read more about them [here](https://github.com/petabyt/fp).

**Note: This hasn't been well-tested and whether it may cause harm is unknown.**
