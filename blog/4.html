<p>It’s hard to believe Fudge is now 2 years old now! This post is a
quick write-up on what has been done in the past year, and what’s ahead.
If you’re not familiar, Fudge is an alternative pairing app for Fujifilm
cameras. See the <a href="https://danielc.dev/blog/fudge1/">previous
write-up</a> to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="release"><a
href="https://github.com/petabyt/fudge/releases/tag/0.2.0">0.2.0
Release</a></h2>
<p>0.2.0 brought a lot of new features and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added compatibility with <a
href="https://www.fujifilm-x.com/en-us/support/download/software/pc-autosave/">PC
AutoSave</a></li>
<li>Added a downloaded photos gallery</li>
<li>Added minimal <a
href="https://app.fujifilm-dsc.com/en/tether/">wireless tether</a>
compatibility</li>
<li>Improved WiFi Android connection process</li>
<li>Improved camera compatibility</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-clone-of-x-raw-studio-that-runs-on-linux">A clone of X Raw
Studio (that runs on Linux!)</h2>
<p>The biggest blocker previously for writing an alternative to X Raw
Studio client was the fact that Fujifilm’s profile format was completely
undocumented. Using <a href="https://github.com/petabyt/vcam">vcam</a>
black-box reverse-engineering and Virtualbox, I was able to <a
href="https://github.com/petabyt/fp">reverse this format</a> in just a
few hours.</p>
<p>I used this to create a <a
href="https://gitlab.futo.org/eron/fubs/-/commit/5fb1de1dec2781d42b082635a54282dab8949708">crude
desktop app</a>, which could serve as the foundations for a more
complete X Raw Studio replacement.</p>
<h2 id="rewriting-the-frontend">Rewriting the frontend</h2>
<p>The current UI is written in Android’s classic views and XML system.
This framework is aging, and will only get slower over time. That and
the fact the current frontend is a <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16771185">state management
mess</a> tells me that it’s time to start looking at more modern
options. My current choice is <a
href="https://developer.android.com/compose"><strong>Jetpack
Compose</strong></a>. You can read more about the frontend rewrite <a
href="https://github.com/petabyt/fudge/issues/26">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="into-the-future">Into the future</h2>
<p>After the frontend is rewritten and stable, the next thing to focus
on is <strong>bluetooth</strong>. A lot of great work on reversing Fuji
bluetooth has been done by <a
href="https://github.com/gkoh/furble">gkoh</a> which means you already
have a great third-party open-source option for pairing with your
camera.</p>
<p>But a third-party open-source app would also be nice to have,
wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>As for how this will work, when it will happen, if it will happen, or
how well it will work. No idea. But it’s something to think about!</p>
<p>But here’s one way it could happen: with the way Fuji cameras ‘hand
off’ camera control from bluetooth to WiFi, it would be possible for
this effort to take place in a <em>completely separate app</em> that can
simply launch Fudge telling it to connect to the camera’s WiFi AP. This
could have the added benefit of being a project in a different language
or framework that could work at a faster or slower pace relative to
Fudge.</p>
